            <h2>How to generate Proguard/R8 rules for Navigation component arguments</h2>
            <img src="img/poster.jpg" height="400" />
            <h3>The background</h3>
            <p>Android Jetpack's <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation">
                    Navigation component</a> is the modern solution for navigating between screens in Android apps.
                It supports both activities and fragments (including dialogs). What is more,
                it allows to <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data">pass data</a>
                to destinations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Unfortunately there is a snag. If you read documentation carefully you'll find
                the <a
                    href="https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/navigation-pass-data#proguard_considerations">Proguard
                    considerations</a> section.
                So every time you use non-primitive argument types you have to remember to either annotate
                its classes with <code>@Keep</code> annotation or add corresponding <code>-keepnames</code> rules
                to Proguard/R8 configuration (of course if you don't obfuscate your code then this problem is
                irrelevant but most apps are obfuscated).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it's not a perfect solution.
                For example when during refactoring you decide to pass something else as an argument (another class)
                you need to either annotate the new class and remove annotation from previous one or update
                affected rules respectively. It's quite inconvenient and error prone (errors in this matter
                will usually be discovered at runtime of non-debug builds).
            </p>
            <h3>Gradle to the rescue!</h3>
            <p>
                It would be better if everything will work out of the box without necessity to make any additional
                changes manually.
                To achieve that we can create a buildscript task which looks for classes used as Navigation component
                arguments
                and then generates Proguard rules.
            </p>
            <p>
                The algorithm is simple:
                <ul>
                    <li>For each XML file with navigation graph:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>For each distinct non-primitive navigation destination argument:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Construct Proguard rule</li>
                            <li>Write rule to the file (create it if not exist)</li>
                        </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Use generate file as Proguard file of the project</li>
                </ul>
                Note that in case of library project you need to use <a
                    href="https://google.github.io/android-gradle-dsl/current/com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.DefaultConfig.html#com.android.build.gradle.internal.dsl.DefaultConfig:consumerProguardFiles">consumer</a>
                Proguard file.
            </p>
            <h4>Show me the code!</h4>
            <p>
                In general, actions performed by buildscripts should be located inside the <a
                    href="https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/more_about_tasks.html">task</a>.
                Task can be defined directly in buildscript. However, for better readability we'll use
                <code>buildSrc</code> folder.
                Let's create a file <code>buildSrc/src/main/kotlin/GenerateNavArgsProguardRulesTask.kt</code> with the
                skeleton:
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/koral--/32efb27912d01e21effcfc165f6e290b.js"></script>
                The class is declared abstract. This is not technically necessary but considered a good practice.
                Gradle does not instantiate task classes directly but rather creates the wrapping subclasses.
                Abstract modifier ensures that subclasses can be created and also prevents direct instantiations
                somewhere in the code.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next step is to declare inputs and outputs:
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/koral--/dda2c1982673a8a781457d722c654dee.js"></script>
                The input consists of all the navigation graph files. For simplicity, only default path of
                main source set is handled. We also assume that there will be no other XML files there.
                The output is a single file with Proguard rules inside project build directory.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note the <code>@InputFiles</code> and <code>@OutputFile</code> annotations. If they are
                present the task will only run when necessary. Roughly speaking if none of inputs and outputs
                are changed since the latest invocation a task is assumed to be up-to-date and Gradle won't
                waste the time on executing it again.
                <code>@SkipWhenEmpty</code> as the name suggests cause that task will be skipped if there no
                input files present. However, it will still execute if list of input files just became empty
                since previous invocation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those annotations and as a consequence not executing unnecessary actions have a significant impact
                on build times. Especially on debug/development builds performed by developers on their local machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now we know what files to read and where to save the results, so let's do the main part of the task!
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/koral--/3d845374aec61c9c54f8942e27f09e58.js"></script>
                The algorithm is as follows:
                <ol>
                    <li>Find all <code>argument</code> nodes.</li>
                    <li>For all these nodes take <code>argType</code> attribute.</li>
                    <li>Filter out primitive types (assuming that their names does not contain a dot).</li>
                    <li>Remove duplicates (by converting to set).</li>
                    <li>For each item create a <code>-keepnames</code> rule.</li>
                    <li>Write each rule to output file.</li>
                </ol>
                Note that XML parser is namespace aware.
            </p>
            <h4>The final touches</h4>
            <p>
                We can optionally set task group and description which will be displayed by Gradle (eg. in
                <code>tasks</code> command)
                or IDE. Additionally we can make our task cacheable.
                The final code looks like that:
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/koral--/20036578ab397c71e682ee57414587ff.js"></script>
            </p>

            <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>
                Tasks need to be registered in order to be invoked. We can also set the dependencies
                so they will be executed automatically.
                In <code>build.gradle.kts</code> it may look like this:
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/koral--/40c8b33aef18238bd544328460e1463d.js"></script>
                <code>preBuild</code> task is executed before building and already registered by Android Gradle Plugin.
                Don't forget to add custom Proguard rules path. Eg. for library project it may be:
                <script src="https://gist.github.com/koral--/6c0f7a9ed4db29c811d249466d4b6bad.js"></script>
            </p>

            <h3>Conclusion</h3>
            <p>
                Automatic generation of Proguard/R8 rules for Navigation Component destination arguments can be
                easily implemented with help of Gradle. Don't forget to properly annotate inputs and outputs of custom 
                Gradle tasks to not hinder build process performance.
            </p>
